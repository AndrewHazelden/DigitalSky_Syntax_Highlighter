# DigitalSky Syntax Highlighters #
**Version 1** Released September 6, 2013  
by Andrew Hazelden

![This is a sample show script that has syntax highlighting](digitalsky_highlighter.png)

## Overview ##

I would like to present a new set of Notepad++, gedit, BBEdit, and TextWrangler syntax highlighting modules that work with scripts from [Sky-Skan's DigitalSky planetarium software](http://www.skyskan.com/products/ds). The new modules make it a lot easier for a planetarium presenter to compose a DigitalSky show script on their Mac, Linux, or Windows based personal computers and laptops away from the main DigitalSky system.

I hope this tool makes it easier for presenters and science visualizers to create fulldome planetarium shows using a plain text editor.

Cheers,  
Andrew Hazelden
